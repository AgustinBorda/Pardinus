# Pardinus

Pardinus - Kodkod's (slightly bulkier) Iberian cousin

It extends Kodkod with the following functionalities:
* Target-oriented and weighted-target oriented model finding (@tmguimaraes, @nmacedo, @alcinocunha);
* Decomposed parallelized model finding (@EduardoPessoa, @nmacedo, @alcinocunha);
* Model finding over temporal relational formulas (@EduardoPessoa, @nmacedo, @alcinocunha);
* Support for unbounded relational model finding (planned).
